# Crypto Market Sentiment Analysis Platform

## Overview
This project combines cryptocurrency price data with sentiment analysis of crypto news to identify market trends, correlations between sentiment and price movements, and develop predictive models. The platform provides insights for cryptocurrency traders and investors by analyzing how news sentiment influences price movements across various cryptocurrencies.

## Features
- **Data Integration**: Alignment of cryptocurrency price data with news sentiment data
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Advanced NLP to extract sentiment from crypto news articles
- **Price Analytics**: Technical indicators and pattern recognition for multiple cryptocurrencies
- **Correlation Analysis**: Measuring relationships between sentiment and price movements
- **Predictive Modeling**: Machine learning models to forecast price movements using both technical and sentiment data
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize insights and monitor real-time market sentiment
- **Trading Signals**: Generate potential trading opportunities based on sentiment-price analysis
