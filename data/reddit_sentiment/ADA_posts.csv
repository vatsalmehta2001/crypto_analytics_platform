2025-03-20 10:53:23,"Traditionally, looking back over the past several years, you could say that BTC often floats around 60% of mcap, ETH around 15%, and the rest (including stablecoins) accounting for the rest.  Obviously, those aren't the exact current amounts (ETH is down a lot) but close enough.  And we can ignore stablecoins, which skews the other numbers.

If I had to put funds in, knowing that you already have a BTC position, I'd probably put 40% into BTC and 40% into ETH, and 20% into just a couple of the others.  I won't say which ones.

If you didn't already have a BTC position, I'd recommend 70% BTC, 20% ETH, and 10% into a few others.

Others on this sub would disagree.  Some people really have a hatred for ETH.  Others feel that it has a lot of potential.  It does represent the majority of actual use of DeFi.  I try to look at everything in an analytical and dispassionate lens.

Disclaimer, I don't have any ETH, but I think it's really oversold right now.  I've had it in the past, and it looks very attractive to me right now.  I think it offers more potential returns than BTC in the medium term, BUT it also represents more risk so I wouldn't go all-in.  However, I do hold some BTC and ETH ETF's.

My bigger concern right now is systemic risk.  I wouldn't feel comfortable putting more into the market right now, because I think things are going to get very bad in the next 12 months due to the geopolitical situation.

2025-03-20 10:53:23,"Traditionally, looking back over the past several years, you could say that BTC often floats around 60% of mcap, ETH around 15%, and the rest (including stablecoins) accounting for the rest.  Obviously, those aren't the exact current amounts (ETH is down a lot) but close enough.  And we can ignore stablecoins, which skews the other numbers.

If I had to put funds in, knowing that you already have a BTC position, I'd probably put 40% into BTC and 40% into ETH, and 20% into just a couple of the others.  I won't say which ones.

If you didn't already have a BTC position, I'd recommend 70% BTC, 20% ETH, and 10% into a few others.

Others on this sub would disagree.  Some people really have a hatred for ETH.  Others feel that it has a lot of potential.  It does represent the majority of actual use of DeFi.  I try to look at everything in an analytical and dispassionate lens.

Disclaimer, I don't have any ETH, but I think it's really oversold right now.  I've had it in the past, and it looks very attractive to me right now.  I think it offers more potential returns than BTC in the medium term, BUT it also represents more risk so I wouldn't go all-in.  However, I do hold some BTC and ETH ETF's.

My bigger concern right now is systemic risk.  I wouldn't feel comfortable putting more into the market right now, because I think things are going to get very bad in the next 12 months due to the geopolitical situation.

2025-03-20 22:02:17,"$36 billion: my educated guess of the amount of none-purchased crypto that miners, exchanges, hackers, coin founders (unlock coins), governments have sold in the past 12 months I had an argue with a friend recently about the amount of none-purchased crypto that have been sold in the past 12 months.  Did some research by quick googling.  

Exchanges selling:  I am guessing maybe around $15 billion a year

Miners selling:  I am guessing maybe around $10 billion a year

Founder selling unlocked coins:  I am guessing maybe $8 billion a year

Hackers selling:  I am guessing maybe $2 billion a year

Government selling confiscated coins:  I am guessing maybe $1 billion a year

Some sources to back up my guess:

Exchanges selling:

Quick google search....coinbase annual revenue is $6.6 billion.

Binance 2022 annual revenue is $12 billion.


Founders selling unlocked coins:  

$3.46 billion in crypto tokens to be unlocked in October 2024

November 2024 will see $2.6 billion worth of crypto tokens unlocked across major blockchain projects, including Sui, Aptos, Arbitrum, and more. These releases will affect market liquidity and token values.

December 2024 will see $5.08 billion worth of tokens unlocked, with $1.99 billion classified as cliff unlocks. Major projects include Jito, Cardano, Aptos, Sui, Arbitrum, and Optimism. Token unlocks could increase market volatility and present buying opportunities.

Jan 15, 2025 — According to CryptoRank, a research and analytics platform focused on crypto data, January will see around $7.2 billion in crypto token unlocks.

In February 2025, the market is set for over $3.13B in token unlocks from major projects like XRP, SUI, JTO, GAL, TAI, and NTRN which could change liquidity levels and influence price trends.

Even cryptodotcom recently  vote to ""unlock"" 70billion CRO over a span of 5 years (about $5 billion USD).

2025-03-20 10:53:23,"Traditionally, looking back over the past several years, you could say that BTC often floats around 60% of mcap, ETH around 15%, and the rest (including stablecoins) accounting for the rest.  Obviously, those aren't the exact current amounts (ETH is down a lot) but close enough.  And we can ignore stablecoins, which skews the other numbers.

If I had to put funds in, knowing that you already have a BTC position, I'd probably put 40% into BTC and 40% into ETH, and 20% into just a couple of the others.  I won't say which ones.

If you didn't already have a BTC position, I'd recommend 70% BTC, 20% ETH, and 10% into a few others.

Others on this sub would disagree.  Some people really have a hatred for ETH.  Others feel that it has a lot of potential.  It does represent the majority of actual use of DeFi.  I try to look at everything in an analytical and dispassionate lens.

Disclaimer, I don't have any ETH, but I think it's really oversold right now.  I've had it in the past, and it looks very attractive to me right now.  I think it offers more potential returns than BTC in the medium term, BUT it also represents more risk so I wouldn't go all-in.  However, I do hold some BTC and ETH ETF's.

My bigger concern right now is systemic risk.  I wouldn't feel comfortable putting more into the market right now, because I think things are going to get very bad in the next 12 months due to the geopolitical situation.

1. You will never make money trading crypto. Just hold it. That course you're looking at with the guy with a rented Lambo telling you he can help you make a living by trading crypto doesn't work. 

2. Buy Bitcoin. Start with Bitcoin. 

3. Don't buy any crypto that doesn't do anything. 
I'll be more specific. Most cryptos don't do nothing.
XRP does nothing. ADA does nothing. 
If it doesn't do anything without hype attached to it don't buy it. 
Ethereum is needed for transactions on the ETH network. See that's something. If ETH transactions increase then potentially ETH will go up. Easy. 

XMR is the only proof of work privacy coin. If you think people will want a private network then perhaps XMR will appreciate in value.

I don't own either. I'm just teaching you what to look for. 

Most cryptos that people talk about have hype and marketing behind them. Things like Bera, SUI, Kas, ADA are just hype machines. Buy something that's been around for a while and the hype is over. If they actually do something (like really do something) then there's a good chance it will go up. 

If all your friends are talking about it, then its already over.

1. You will never make money trading crypto. Just hold it. That course you're looking at with the guy with a rented Lambo telling you he can help you make a living by trading crypto doesn't work. 

2. Buy Bitcoin. Start with Bitcoin. 

3. Don't buy any crypto that doesn't do anything. 
I'll be more specific. Most cryptos don't do nothing.
XRP does nothing. ADA does nothing. 
If it doesn't do anything without hype attached to it don't buy it. 
Ethereum is needed for transactions on the ETH network. See that's something. If ETH transactions increase then potentially ETH will go up. Easy. 

XMR is the only proof of work privacy coin. If you think people will want a private network then perhaps XMR will appreciate in value.

I don't own either. I'm just teaching you what to look for. 

Most cryptos that people talk about have hype and marketing behind them. Things like Bera, SUI, Kas, ADA are just hype machines. Buy something that's been around for a while and the hype is over. If they actually do something (like really do something) then there's a good chance it will go up. 

If all your friends are talking about it, then its already over.

1. You will never make money trading crypto. Just hold it. That course you're looking at with the guy with a rented Lambo telling you he can help you make a living by trading crypto doesn't work. 

2. Buy Bitcoin. Start with Bitcoin. 

3. Don't buy any crypto that doesn't do anything. 
I'll be more specific. Most cryptos don't do nothing.
XRP does nothing. ADA does nothing. 
If it doesn't do anything without hype attached to it don't buy it. 
Ethereum is needed for transactions on the ETH network. See that's something. If ETH transactions increase then potentially ETH will go up. Easy. 

XMR is the only proof of work privacy coin. If you think people will want a private network then perhaps XMR will appreciate in value.

I don't own either. I'm just teaching you what to look for. 

Most cryptos that people talk about have hype and marketing behind them. Things like Bera, SUI, Kas, ADA are just hype machines. Buy something that's been around for a while and the hype is over. If they actually do something (like really do something) then there's a good chance it will go up. 

If all your friends are talking about it, then its already over.

2025-03-22 18:50:57,"I feel like a loser I own 5.3 Bitcoin but in 2014/2017 I sold soooo many Bitcoin in order to short Tesla - which I thought it was overvalued and about to crash. I shorted with long dated puts - so I did not lose more than my puts price - but still I feel like a fudging idiot… if I was just holding on to my 95 btc by now I would retire and be safe for the rest of my life… instead I sold Bitcoin, shorted Tesla and I ended up with only 5 bitcoin… sometime I just cannot take the pain no more…. How can I make peace with my old decision and look forward instead of backward? ",0,94,https://i.redd.it/u3i603d0faqe1.jpeg,Bitcoin,1jhfmxk,post,0.9167,0.168,0.07,0.762,1,0.762
